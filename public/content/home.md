## ðŸ§  Prompting Under Pressure: Research Overview

### Research Focus
This project investigates how cognitive load and stress affect user interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the length, specificity, and quality of prompts.

### Research Questions
- How does stress/cognitive load affect the quality of prompt formulation?
- To what extent does it influence reliance on prompting strategies and perceived task success?
- Are there measurable differences in LLM performance across baseline, stress, and overload conditions?

### Motivation
LLMs are increasingly used in high-pressure scenarios, yet little is known about how stress shapes prompting behaviour and task outcomes. This research addresses that gap from a human-centered perspective.

### Methodology
- **Participants:** 30+, aged 18â€“45, fluent in English, with prior LLM experience
- **Data Collection:**
  - Surveys (demographics, anxiety levels)
  - Experimental tasks (baseline, cognitive load, acute stress)
  - Analysis of prompt history (length, specificity, strategy)

### Expected Contributions
- Empirical evidence on the relationship between stress and LLM prompt quality
- Design insights for stress-resilient LLM interfaces
- Recommendations for inclusive AI systems supporting diverse real-world conditions
